/**
 * The Promise object is used for asynchronous computations. A Promise represents an operation that
 * hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;A Promise represents a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created.
 * It allows you to associate dependent promises to an asynchronous action's eventual success value
 * or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead
 * of the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise of having a value at some point in
 * the future.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Promises provide a few advantages over callback objects:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt; Functional composition and error handling
 * &lt;li&gt; Prevents callback hell and provides callback aggregation
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In this application the usage of promise is demonstrated with two examples:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;Count Lines: In this example a file is downloaded and its line count is calculated.
 * The calculated line count is then consumed and printed on console.
 * &lt;li&gt;Lowest Character Frequency: In this example a file is downloaded and its lowest frequency
 * character is found and printed on console. This happens via a chain of promises, we start with
 * a file download promise, then a promise of character frequency, then a promise of lowest
 * frequency character which is finally consumed and result is printed on console.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
